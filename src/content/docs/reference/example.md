This glossary provides definitions for common terms you'll encounter in game development.

## A

- **Asset**: Any resource used in a game, such as 3D models, textures, sounds, or scripts.
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of intelligent behavior in non-player characters (NPCs) or game systems.

## B

- **Beta**: A pre-release version of a game for testing purposes.
- **Bug**: An error or flaw in the game that produces unintended results.

## C

- **Collision Detection**: The process of determining when two game objects intersect or collide.
- **Cutscene**: A non-interactive sequence in a game that advances the story or provides information.

## E

## G

- **Gameplay**: The specific way in which players interact with a game.
- **Game Loop**: The overall flow of a game program, typically involving processing input, updating game state, and rendering.

## L

- **Physics Engine**: A computer software that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems.

## R

- **Rendering**: The process of generating an image from a 2D or 3D model.

## S

- **Sprite**: A 2D bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, often in 2D games.

## T

- **Texture**: An image used to add detail, color, or surface texture to a 3D model or 2D sprite.

## V
